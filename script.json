    "I HIRE PEOPLE": "TBD",
    "PEOPLE HIRE ME": "I take it you're here to check out if it makes sense to engage with my master? Well you'll be pleased to hear Ondrej is not a regular agency guy that spams your inbox every day as he is not exactly money driven.\nThis good feeling from seeing fun teams growing around him is what he likes about his job above all (Do not worry, I do not get that either). But for you it means his interest in people is genuine (especially if you happen to be a geek like him). So yep, do get in touch!\n %[is it worth it](postback:is_it_worth_it) %[geek you say](postback:geek_you_say) %[get social](postback:get_social)",
    "GEEK YOU SAY": "Ondrej's father is a sci-fi/fantasy writer - thanks to his influence, my master has finished reading the Tolkien trilogy when he was 7 and hardly stopped since then. Remember those news when hardcore fans were going to cinemas in cosplays? That was him pretty much back then. Have things got better?\n Not really - swordsmanship, anime/manga, gaming, classical music... Sometimes I wonder how he managed to stay social, really.\n ...Even now he dreams of recruiting devs through playing Heartstone (Battletag Verlajn #2857)...Is this where you humans use facepalms?\n %[is it worth it](postback:is_it_worth_it) %[get social](postback:get_social) %[Head to career](postback:head_to_career)",
    "IS IT WORTH IT": "Definitely! My master is not afraid of simple APIs, Heroku or learning simple HTML/CSS and will gladly listen to your favorite topics for hours. An office full of techies and nerf guns is his natural habitat and you will be happy to finally meet a recruiter that needs no explaination of what JVM is. %[geek you say](postback:geek_you_say) %[get social](postback:get_social) %[IDK Entertain me](postback:IDK_entertain_me)",
    "GET SOCIAL": "Yeeey that guy will love to see new faces when he climbs down from that mountain!! %[Tweet Ondrej](http://ctt.ec/TfC_f)\n %[or Connect on LI?](http://bit.ly/1VUs5rq)\n %[Head to career](postback:head_to_career)",
    "IDK ENTERTAIN ME": "Well my master has a terrible sense of humor so I cannot get any better than that. I am not happy about that either...\nBut at the very least I can perhaps let you see Ondrej from a bit of a different perspective? %[Bring it on](postback:bring_it_on) %[Head to career](postback:head_to_career) %[restart](postback:restart)",
    "HEAD TO CAREER": "While in general Ondrej loves Learning&Development, public speaking, organizing workshops&conferences, HR, coaching, inspiring and leading others (insert more buzzwords here) it all currently revolves around technical recruitment.\nCurrently he's L&D RPO Specialist in Hudson, Edinburgh. Before, he was one of two first recruiters to work with STRV back in Prague.

    "STRV": "In a two person team with Domca Hornakova and with the COO Lubo Smid, we managed to start a process that moved STRV from about 40 people in January 2015 to 100+ employees in 9 months, most of them being star developers from all over Europe.\n We introduced Silicon Valley Insights program with speakers from coolest companies in the Bay Area, started working with key universities, organized fun hackatons and much more. STRV today stands as one of the most attractive employers for top-notch developers and designers.\n %[STRV Blogpost](http://bit.ly/1s1qZgE) %[Responsibilities in STRV](postback:responsibilities_in_STRV)",

    "RESPONSIBILITIES IN STRV": "Honestly, everything that was needed in a fast growing startup. Basically me, Domca and Lubo had to manage everything you need to launch succesful recruitment from a scratch.\n To Set up the recruitment process, measure and optimize it, develop long-term friendly relationships with our target groups, co-create social tech events, to source, develop recruitment strategy, interview and select candidates...\n deliver feedback on candidates to COO after each individual passed the hiring process, plus moderating tech events...\n Sorry did you just fall asleep? Anyway, I reported directly to COO and other co-founders...\n OK I get it enough is enough.

What do you want to see first? %[Head to career](postback:head_to_career) %[get in touch](postback:get_in_touch) %[IDK Entertain me](postback:IDK_entertain_me)",
    "PEOPLE HIRE ME": "I take it you're here to check out if it makes sense to engage with my master? Well you'll hopefully get convinced pretty soon that you can chat with my master about anything and everything and yet at the same time he can support you on your way to find the role in which you will do the best work of your career\nThis good feeling from seeing fun teams growing around him is what he likes about his job above all - and his interest in people is genuine (especially if you happen to be a geek like him).

    "GEEK YOU SAY": "Ondrej's father is a sci-fi/fantasy writer - thanks to his influence, my master has finished reading the Tolkien trilogy when he was 7 and hardly stopped since then. Remember those news when hardcore fans were going to cinemas in cosplays? That was him pretty much back then. Have things got better?\n Not really - swordsmanship, anime/manga, gaming, classical music... Sometimes I wonder how he managed to stay social, really.\n ...Even now he dreams of recruiting devs through playing Heartstone (Battletag Verlajn #2857)...Is this where you humans use facepalms? %[is it worth it](postback:is_it_worth_it) %[get in touch](postback:get_in_touch) %[Head to career](postback:head_to_career)",
    "IS IT WORTH IT": "Definitely! My master is not afraid of simple APIs, Heroku or learning simple HTML/CSS and will gladly listen to your favorite topics for hours.

    "IDK ENTERTAIN ME": "Well my master has a terrible sense of humor so I cannot get any better than that.

    "HEAD TO CAREER": "While in general Ondrej loves Learning&Development, public speaking, organizing workshops&conferences and calibrating processes, it all currently revolves around technical recruitment.\nCurrently he's a Tech Recruiter at Facebook in London.

    "RESPONSIBILITIES IN STRV": "Honestly, everything that was needed in a fast growing startup.
